# PyBoardTypeshed

Typeshed (type hint interface `.pyi`) for a PyBoard, i.e. type hints and documentation for functions, classes, and constants in modules `pyb` and `uarray`.
`uarray` is included because it is needed for `pyb`.
These typesheds are useful for IDEs that understand type hints, like PyCharm and VSCode, and for IDE plugins like the PyCharm MicroPython plugin.
